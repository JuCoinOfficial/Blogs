## Butterfly Protocol: A New Paradigm for Digital Assets

The summit’s climax came with the official global launch of the Butterfly Protocol. In a ceremonial moment, key speakers placed their hands on the launch device as a countdown began, culminating in the beautiful butterfly animation blooming across screens, marking the official debut of JuChain’s flagship protocol.

Butterfly Strategy Committee Chief Advisor Mark provided an in-depth analysis of the protocol’s innovative design. Butterfly addresses the dual needs of asset security and growth in the current crypto market through its unique “dual-wing” architecture:

- Left Wing — Stability Anchor: Utilizes a portion of user principal as insurance reserves, combined with the innovative “Cocoon Protection Layer” mechanism to provide robust asset protection.

- Right Wing — Power Fuel: Channels remaining funds into a “Liquidity Rocket Engine” that pursues value appreciation through efficient strategies, targeting sustainable daily compound growth of 1–3%.

> “Butterfly Protocol represents more than just a technical breakthrough,” Mark explained. “It embodies our commitment to users — ensuring their assets remain both secure and positioned for growth in the Web3 ecosystem.”

## Looking Forward

The successful summit demonstrates JuChain’s comprehensive approach to building a service-driven Web3 ecosystem.

With the Butterfly Protocol now live and expanding ecosystem partnerships, JuChain continues to advance its mission of making Web3 technology more accessible, secure, and valuable for users and developers worldwide.
